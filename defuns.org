* Compiling
  Helper for compilation. Close the compilation window if there was no
  error at all.

  ;; If M-x compile exists with a 0
  (when (and (eq status 'exit) (zerop code))
    ;; then bury the *compilation* buffer, so that C-x b doesn't go there
    (bury-buffer)
    ;; and delete the *compilation* window
    (delete-window (get-buffer-window (get-buffer "*compilation*"))))
  ;; Always return the anticipated result of compilation-exit-message-function
  (cons msg code))

* Switching buffers
  Switch between a c/c++ header (.h) and its corresponding source
  (.c/.cpp). Not my code.
